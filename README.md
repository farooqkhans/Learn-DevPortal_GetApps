# Learn-DevPortal_GetApps

## Project Description

Get an application using the OAuth1 authorization mechanism.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using the package manager of your choice.
3. Configure any necessary environment variables.
4. Start the application.

## OAuth
OAuth is an open standard for authorization that allows users to grant access to their resources on one website to another website without sharing their credentials. It is commonly used by developers to enable third-party applications to access user data from various platforms, such as social media sites or APIs.

This project demonstrates how to use the OAuth1 authorization mechanism to fetch application values from a DevPortal. It utilizes the `oauthlib` package to construct OAuth requests and interact with the DevPortal API.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DevPortal-OAuth1-GetApps.git
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Configure the necessary environment variables by creating a `config.ini` file in the `config` directory. The `config.ini` file should have the following structure:
    ```ini
    [OAuth]
    clientKey = YOUR_CLIENT_KEY
    clientSecret = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    siteId = YOUR_SITE_ID
    appId = YOUR_APP_ID
    cloudDomain = YOUR_CLOUD_DOMAIN
    devportalDomain = YOUR_DEVPORTAL_DOMAIN
    ```

5. Run the application to get the application values:
    ```bash
    python GetApplication.py
    ```

This will retrieve the application values using the OAuth1 authorization mechanism.

Please note that you need to replace the placeholders (`YOUR_CLIENT_KEY`, `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`, etc.) with your actual values.
